# how to train?
first, download the data from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
make sure the varible 
# 
is_train = True
```  
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py
```  
# how to test?
make sure the varible 
#
is_train = False
```  
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py
```  

# result
1. cifar-10: Acc-95.4(Top-1 err 4.6) with ResidualAttentionModel_92_32input_update(higher than paper top-1 err 4.99)

# model fileï¼š 
model_92_sgd.pkl is the trained model file, accuracy of 0.954
